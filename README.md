# Data Science Capstone Project Coursera
## Next Word Prediction (NWP)

### Project

**Problem**: Around the world, people are spending a considerable amount of time to write messages or posts on their phone/computer. However, this process can be laborious and several companies such as SwiftKey *(corporate partner of this Captsone)* implemented smart keyboards based on predictive text models to make it easier for people to type their text.

**Capstone project**: the aim of this project is to apply all knowledge and skills we acquired during the specialization to build a predictive text product.
